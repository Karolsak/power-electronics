Description: This directory contains the simulation files for simulating two full-bridge dc-dc converters with unipolar PWM interaced through an inductor.

Circuit schematics:
- full_bridge_conv1.csv with parameters in full_bridge_conv1_params.csv (for the left converter)
- full_bridge_conv2.csv with parameters in full_bridge_conv2_params.csv (for the right converter)
- interface.csv with parameters in interface_params.csv

Control files:
- gate_signal1.py with control variables in descriptor gate_signal1_desc.csv (for the left converter)
- gate_signal2.py with control variables in descriptor gate_signal2_desc.csv (for the right converter)

Will generate:
- ckt_output.dat (default simulator output file)
- plotkey.txt with a list of all the variables written to the ckt_output.dat file above. Can be used by the user to plot the variables with another software like Matplotlib.
- auto_plot.py: This file will only be generated if the "Export to Matplotlib" button in the Output Page after running the simulation. This file will contain a sample Matplotlib file with all the plots that have been defined in the output page by the user.
