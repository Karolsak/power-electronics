Description: This directory contains the programs the demonstrate the advantage of PWM over rectangular waveform approximation of a sine waveform. The file also contains a frequency response segment that performs DFT.

Files:
rectangular_wavform.py: This file converts a sine waveform to a rectangular waveform and examines the frequency response.
sine_pwm.py: This file performs sine-triangle comparison to generate pulses of varying width in the form a basic PWM and examines the frequency response.

Will generate:
Plots that can be optionally saved as .eps files.
