Description: This directory contains the simulation files for simulating an buck converter.

Circuit schematics:
buck_conv.csv with parameters in buck_conv_params.csv

Control files:
gate_signal.py with control variables in descriptor gate_signal_desc.csv

Other files:
- freq_analysis.py: Can perform frequency analysis on any variable stored in ckt_output.dat file below. The user will need to use the order of variables in plotkey.txt to be able to extract the variables.

Will generate:
- ckt_output.dat (default simulator output file)
- plotkey.txt with a list of all the variables written to the ckt_output.dat file above. Can be used by the user to plot the variables with another software like Matplotlib.
- auto_plot.py: This file will only be generated if the "Export to Matplotlib" button in the Output Page after running the simulation. This file will contain a sample Matplotlib file with all the plots that have been defined in the output page by the user.
