Description: This directory contains the programs the demonstrate the basic concept of Amplitude Modulation (AM). Each file also contains a frequency response segment that performs DFT.

Files:
AM_concept.py: This file uses a steady audio signal as the modulating signal for AM
AM_random_signal.py: This file adds a randomness to the magnitude and frequency of the steady audio signal and describes how the frequency response captures this variation in frequency.

Will generate:
Plots that can be optionally saved as .eps files.
