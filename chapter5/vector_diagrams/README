Description: This directory contains Python files for generating vector diagrams for the three-phase three-leg two-level converter.

Files:
- line_neutral_vector_diagram.py: Generates a vector diagram with line-neutral output voltages of the converter
- line_line_vector_diagram.py: Generates a vector diagram with line-line output voltages of the converter
- vector_algortithm_line_neutral.py: Python file for formulating SVPWM algorithm using line-neutral output voltages of the converter
- converter_capacity.py: Python file to determine the capacity of a converter using vector diagrams

Will generate:
- Console logs with vector tables
- Optionally .eps files of vector diagrams
